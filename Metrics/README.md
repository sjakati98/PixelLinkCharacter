# IoU

IoU is defined as the Intersection Over Union. The purpose of this metric is to determine the average IoU of the predicted bounding boxes against the ground truth bounding boxes.

To use `IoU.py`, provide the following information as such:
```
python IoU.py /path/to/predicted /path/to/ground_truth
```
